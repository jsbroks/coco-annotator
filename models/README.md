# Example Models for Assisted Annotations

This section explains the process of using an exisitng model to
help annotate your dataset. As your create more data, your model's
accuracy increases which then can be used to create more training
data.

For information on setup and using a model please check out the [wiki]().

## Models

Each model is served over flasking using a post HTTP request. The request
must accept an image and return COCO json. View the example models for more
insight.

You can customize these models by using the weights generated by your use
case. If you write a webserver for a model not in the current list, please
share by sending a pull request.

### MaskRCNN

The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each
instance of an object in the image.
